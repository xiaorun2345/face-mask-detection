# face-mask-detection
With the ongoing pandemic in Guangzhou, it’s even more important to have advanced analytics apps   and services in place to mitigate risk. For public safety and health, authorities   are recommending the use of face masks and coverings to control the spread of COVID-19.  In this project, we show experiments using TLT to train a face mask detection model   and then using the DeepStream SDK to perform efficient, real-time deployment of the trained model.  Face mask detection systems are now increasingly important, especially in bus for effective patient care.   They’re also important in stadiums, airports, warehouses, and other crowded spaces where foot traffic is heavy and   safety regulations are critical to safeguarding everyone’s health.
